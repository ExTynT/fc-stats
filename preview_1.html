            Leading 3-2 on aggregate and hosting this second leg of the quarter-final, Barcelona are in a commanding position as they welcome PSG. The Catalan giants are poised to secure their first UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-final appearance since 2018/19 following their victory in the previous leg, a match marked by ups and downs where Xavi’s team initially took the lead, then fell behind, only to rally and emerge triumphant.

            This outcome grants Barcelona the advantage of knowing that a draw will suffice to advance. With a favorable track record at home against French opponents (W9, D2, L2), they should feel confident about their prospects. However, a recent 4-1 defeat at home against PSG casts a shadow of uncertainty over their minds, reminding them that the tie is far from over despite their historical success in progressing 37 out of 39 times after winning the first leg away in UEFA competitions.

            For PSG, overturning a deficit of four goals from the first leg might seem daunting, but there is precedent in this fixture. Only one previous occasion in UCL history has witnessed such a comeback, and it occurred in this very matchup, giving PSG hope that a two-goal victory within regulation time is within reach, especially with talents like Kylian Mbappé in their ranks.

            However, memories of a past defeat linger for PSG, as they suffered a 6-1 loss in the away leg when current Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was in charge, underscoring their mediocre away record against Spanish opponents (W6, D3, L9). Given PSG's tendency to lose the away leg in UEFA competition ties where they faltered in the first leg at home, it's likely that their away loss tally will increase, possibly reaching double digits.

            Key players to watch include Raphinha, who netted his first-ever UCL goals in the first leg, and PSG's Mbappé, who secured a hat-trick in their previous encounter held at Barcelona's home ground and has shown prowess in scoring in Spain, as evidenced by his brace against Real Sociedad in the round of 16.

            <b>An interesting statistic to note is that in 11 of PSG’s last 12 UCL away matches, both teams found the net, indicating a trend worth considering.</b>
