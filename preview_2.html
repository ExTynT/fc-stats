        <p>
            In a pivotal clash for a spot in this season's UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-finals, Borussia Dortmund aim to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg against Spanish powerhouse Atlético Madrid. The first leg encounter leveled the head-to-head record between these teams (W3, D1, L3), and Dortmund, buoyed by a recent resurgence with six wins in eight competitive matches, enter this match with optimism.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although Dortmund's record against Spanish opponents isn't the strongest (W11, D12, L14), they have secured eight of those victories on home turf (W8, D7, L3). Overcoming a psychological barrier, Dortmund have been eliminated in each of their last five UCL quarter-final appearances, but their history of progressing in eight out of 18 European ties after losing the away first leg suggests a tangible chance.

            <br>
            Atlético Madrid strengthened their claim for a La Liga top-four finish with a convincing 3-1 win over Girona, marking their third consecutive victory. Diego Simeone, the long-serving manager, has guided Atlético to the UCL semi-finals on three occasions before, with the last one dating back to 2016/17. Another semi-final appearance would elevate Simeone alongside Sir Alex Ferguson in reaching the most semi-finals with the same club.

            <br>
            However, Atlético faces a daunting task in Germany, having suffered seven defeats in their last ten visits (W2, D1, L7), including losses in their last four games, all under Simeone's tenure. Their defensive solidity will be tested, as they have managed just one clean sheet in their last 16 competitive away matches, including three UCL outings (W1, D1, L1).

            <br>
            Key players to watch include Dortmund's Karim Adeyemi, who will aim to make an impact before serving a domestic ban, and Atlético's Antoine Griezmann, tasked with leading the scoring line in the absence of Depay and Lino. Griezmann arrives in fine form after netting a league brace over the weekend and has previously found the net against Dortmund for both Barcelona and Atlético.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Dortmund's home record in the UCL remains formidable, boasting an unbeaten streak of nine matches (W5, D4), which stands as their longest such run in the competition's history.</b>
